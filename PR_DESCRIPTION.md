# Terminal Server Redesign

## Overview

This PR implements a comprehensive redesign of the iOS Terminal Server backend to address several key issues:

1. **Removes file operation HTTP endpoints** and integrates file operations directly into terminal commands
2. **Enhances terminal emulation** to better replicate a Linux terminal's capabilities
3. **Improves session management** with better persistence and isolation
4. **Streamlines endpoints** by removing testing terminals while preserving documentation
5. **Enhances architecture** with modular components for better maintainability

## Key Components

1. **TerminalCommandHandler**: Executes commands with integrated file operations
2. **SessionManager**: Handles session creation, validation, and cleanup with persistence
3. **EnvironmentSetup**: Creates and configures user environments
4. **Enhanced Flask Server**: WebSocket and HTTP API with streamlined endpoints

## Changes

- Removed HTTP endpoints for file operations (list, download, upload, delete)
- Removed testing terminal interfaces via `/ws` and `/ios-terminal` routes
- Added comprehensive terminal emulation with proper environment setup
- Enhanced session management with persistence across server restarts
- Added better file operation integration through terminal commands
- Preserved documentation endpoint

## Testing

1. WebSocket terminal operation with real-time output
2. File operations through terminal commands (ls, cat, mkdir, rm, etc.)
3. Session persistence and isolation
4. Documentation endpoint accessibility

## Documentation

- Updated README.md with new architecture details
- Added REDESIGN.md with comprehensive redesign explanation
- Added API_CHANGES.md documenting API changes for migration
